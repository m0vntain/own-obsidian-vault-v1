## Embrace Motivation Mindset
### Understanding your obstacles
1. **Uncertainty about Priorities**: 
	- seek guidance from your manager or experienced colleagues
	- choose one priority to focus on temporarily.
2. **Lack of Clarity on How to Achieve Goals**: 
	- seek more information from your manager
	- learn from those who've achieved similar goals for actionable insights.
3. **Perceived Difficulty or Boredom**:
	- find small rewards to keep yourself motivated to make tasks more bearable.
- *prioritizing, clear goal setting, maintaining motivation* - crucial for leading teams effectively

### Reframing the challenge
strategies to change your perspective on tasks you might find unappealing or difficult:

- **Recall Past Successes**: Remember times you've overcome challenges before, which can boost your confidence in tackling current tasks.
- **Consider the Consequences of Inaction**: Think about how not completing a task could negatively impact your future, leveraging loss aversion to motivate action.
- **Invoke Your Best Self**: Reflect on what the best version of yourself would do and let that guide your actions, especially when feeling unmotivated.


### Getting unstuck
overcome moments of low motivation or feeling stuck:

- **Break Down Tasks**: Divide big projects into smaller, manageable steps to clarify what needs to be done and make starting easier.
- **Improve Your Environment**: Work in a pleasant or different setting to boost your mood and productivity. This could mean tidying your workspace or changing locations.
- **Choose an Alternative Task**: If a particular task feels daunting, switch to another necessary task. This can kickstart your productivity and may indirectly motivate you to tackle the original task.


## Creating Structure to Succeed
### Plan your time
strategic time management to boost motivation and productivity:

- **Estimating Task Duration**: Assess how long tasks will take to better allocate your time and identify when you might need additional resources or adjustments to your schedule.
- **Advance Planning**: Map out your time for tasks in advance to enhance efficiency and ensure you're prepared for what's ahead, reducing the likelihood of feeling overwhelmed.
- **Adopting the 'Just Three Things' Strategy**: Each day, choose three key tasks to focus on. This helps in making your day feel successful and manageable, regardless of the size of the tasks.

### Enlisting other's support
leverage social support to achieve goals:

- **Making Commitments**: Publicly or privately committing to your goals with others can significantly boost your accountability and motivation, 
- **Leveraging Social Interaction**: Drawing on the expertise and energy of friends, colleagues, or even setting up coworking dates can provide additional motivation and make tackling projects less isolating.

### Taking the first step
 initiating action on (daunting) projects or tasks:
 
 - **Start with the Smallest Action**: Embrace the idea of beginning with the most minimal effort possible, like flossing just one tooth. This approach helps overcome the psychological barrier to getting started.
- **Aim for a Quick Win**: Seek out an immediate success to gain positive feedback early in the process, which can be motivating and reinforce your commitment to the task.
- **Just Start Anywhere**: Avoid overanalyzing where to begin. Choosing any starting point can help build momentum and make the task feel more manageable.
