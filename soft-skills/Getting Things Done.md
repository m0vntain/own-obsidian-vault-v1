## The five steps of Getting Things Done
1. **Capture**: Recognize and collect anything that has your attention. It's about identifying tasks and commitments that aren't currently being managed.  
2. **Clarify**: Make decisions about the items you've captured. Determine what each item means to you and what action it requires.  
3. **Organize**: Place the results of your clarification into organized systems. This step ensures that everything has its place and can be easily accessed when needed.  
4. **Reflect**: Regularly review and reflect on your commitments and tasks. This overview allows you to maintain control and focus on your priorities.  
5. **Engage**: With a clear understanding of your tasks and priorities, choose and engage with your tasks confidently.


## Getting Things Done
### Step 1: Capturing things
1. **Importance of Capture**: 
	- includes tasks, ideas, and anything else that occupies your mind.  
2. **Use of Physical Tools**: 
	- physical tools like an in-tray to gather all items that represent incomplete tasks or decisions
	- anything from documents to physical objects that need attention. 
3. **Mind Sweep**
	- to ensure that all tasks and ideas are collected from your mind and documented
	- writing down everything that has your attention (from one to six hours)  
4. **Trusted System**: 
	- “trusted system” or “trusted bucket” - where captured items are placed
	- reliable, ensuring that nothing gets lost
5. **Tools for Capturing**:
	- use whatever tool ensures that ideas and tasks are captured and not forgotten.  
6. **Your Head is Not an Office**: 
	- mind is for having ideas, not holding them.
	- practice of capturing everything outside your head

### Step 2: Clarifying meaning
- **Decision Making on Captured Items**: 
	- crucial to decide what each captured item means and what action it requires
	- asking whether the item is actionable
	- determining the next steps. 
- **Actionable vs. Non-Actionable Items**: 
	- Items are categorized as actionable or non-actionable. 
	- *Non-actionable* items 
		- can be trashed, incubated for future review
		- filed as reference material. 
	- *Actionable items* 
		- require you to define the next physical action
		- identify the project they belong to (require more than one action)
- **Clarifying Leads to Organizing**: 
	- clarifying sets the stage for organizing these items effectively in the system

### Do, delegate, defer
- **Two-Minute Rule**: If an action can be completed in two minutes or less, do it immediately. 
- **Delegation**: For tasks that require more than two minutes, consider if someone else can do it. If yes, delegate it. . 
- **Deferral**: If a task cannot be delegated and requires more than two minutes, defer it. Organize these tasks into your system as reminders for later action.

### Step 3: Organizing where things belong
- **List Creation for Organization**: 
	- organize clarified tasks into lists based on categories or by project
- **Use of Calendars and Next Actions Lists**: 
	- tasks that need to be scheduled on a *calendar* (time-specific)
	- tasks that can go on a *Next Actions list* (to be done as soon as possible).  
- **Importance of a Projects List**: 
	- separate list for multi-step projects to keep track: 
		- overall progress
		- next steps

### Step 4: Reflecting on and reviewing your tasks
- **Regular Reviews Are Essential**: 
	- Engaging with lists through regular review
	- to ensure awareness of commitments
	- can prioritize effectively.  
- **Multiple Levels of Review**: 
	- Reflecting and reviewing should happen at various levels:
		- *daily* checks of your calendar, next actions lists
		- *weekly* reviews of your projects and goals
- **Weekly Review Importance**: 
	- looking at your project list, upcoming calendar events, and any new tasks that need to be captured and clarified. 
- **Creating Space for Reflection**: 
	- catch up and prepare for the upcoming tasks and responsibilities.

### Step 5: Engaging the tasks
- **Engagement Through Prior Steps**: 
	- built upon completing the first four steps of the GTD methodology—capture, clarify, organize, and reflect. 
	- allows for intuitive and trusted decision-making  
- **Engagement Isn't Just Hard Work**: 
	- doesn't always mean working harder or longer
	- involves knowing when to step back, reflect, or even take a break to maintain productivity and well-being
- **Trusted Choice Making**: 
	- clear system and mind: make trusted choices about where to focus attention
	- making informed decisions based on a comprehensive understanding of commitments and priorities
